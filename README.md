# Spring Boot Testing Guide

This document provides an overview of important practices and tools for testing in Spring Boot applications.

## Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation using mocking frameworks like Mockito.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between multiple components. Use the Spring context but often exclude external dependencies.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Test the complete flow of the application including database, messaging, etc.

## Testing Frameworks

- **JUnit 5**: The primary testing framework.
- **Mockito**: For creating mock objects.
- **Spring Test**: Provides support classes for integration testing with Spring context.
- **AssertJ/Hamcrest**: For fluent and human-readable assertions.
- **Testcontainers**: For running tests against real databases or services in Docker containers.

## Annotations

- **@SpringBootTest**: Boots up the full Spring context.
- **@WebMvcTest**: Tests only the web layer.
- **@DataJpaTest**: Tests the JPA layer, using an in-memory database.
- **@MockBean**: Replaces a bean in the Spring context with a mock.
- **@SpyBean**: Replaces a bean with a spy, allowing for partial mocking.
- **@TestConfiguration**: Defines additional beans or overrides beans for the tests.

## Testing Best Practices

- **Isolation**: Keep unit tests isolated from external systems.
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should be quick to run.
- **Readable and Maintainable**: Write tests that are easy to read and maintain.
- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive test method names to clearly convey the purpose of the test.
- **AAA Pattern**: Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to structure tests.

## Mocking and Stubbing

- **Mockito**: Use Mockito to mock dependencies and stub methods.
  ```java
  @Mock
  private MyService myService;

  @Test
  public void testMyMethod() {
      when(myService.someMethod()).thenReturn(someValue);
      // ...test code...
  }
